### Dockerize Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to build upon [Ascii-Art program](https://github.com/abmutungi/01-founders-ascii-art) and create one Dockerfile, image and a container.

This project introduced me to :

- Client utilities.
- The basics of web :
  - Server
  - HTML
  - HTTP
- Ways to receive data.
- Ways to output data.
- Learning what is docker.
- Using and setting up Docker :

  - Containerizing an application.
  - Compatibility/Dependency.
  - Creating images.
